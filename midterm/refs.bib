abstract = {<p>New verticals within the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm such as smart cities, smart farming, or goods monitoring, among many others, are demanding strong requirements to the Radio Access Network (RAN) in terms of coverage, end-node’s power consumption, and scalability. The technologies employed so far to provide IoT scenarios with connectivity, e.g., wireless sensor network and cellular technologies, are not able to simultaneously cope with these three requirements. Thus, a novel solution known as Low Power - Wide Area Network (LP-WAN) has emerged as a promising alternative to provide with low-cost and low-power-consumption connectivity to end-nodes spread in a wide area. Concretely, the Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology is one of the LP-WAN platforms that is receiving greater attention from both the industry and the academia. For that reason, in this work, a comprehensive performance evaluation of LoRaWAN under different environmental conditions is presented. The results are obtained from three real scenarios, namely, urban, suburban, and rural, considering both dynamic and static conditions, hence a discussion about the most proper LoRaWAN physical-layer configuration for each scenario is provided. Besides, a theoretical coverage study is also conducted by the use of a radio planning tool considering topographic maps and a precise propagation model. From the attained results, it can be concluded that it is necessary to evaluate the propagation conditions of the deployment scenario prior to the system implantation in order to reach a compromise between the robustness of the network and the transmission data-rate.</p>},

abstract = {<p>Livestock is an essential commodity, especially in Indonesia, an agricultural country located in the Asia Pacific. Indonesia has vaster Greenland area than any other ASEAN countries. One way to increase livestock production is by implementing Smart Livestock Monitoring System which relies on Internet of Things technology such as LoRa. LoRa and other Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) technologies offer great advantages such as extended transmission range, extended node's battery life, and a massive number of nodes per gateway support. However, LoRa utilizes sub 1 GHz unlicensed spectrum which has been very crowded since the last decades and will be even more crowded soon following IoT trends. We propose to use mobile LoRa gateway to mitigate this issue. This paper simulates and compares deployments of LoRa using one mobile gateway with one and multiple static gateways. LoRa is simulated using one mobile gateway and compared with one and multiple static gateway deployments. Simulation result shows that one static gateway is better for narrow livestock area because it gives sufficient Data Extraction Rate (DER) value required for data transmission and lowest Network Energy Consumption (NEC) value. Otherwise, for vast livestock area, one mobile gateway is better because of smaller deployment cost and more than sufficient DER value.</p>},

abstract = {<p>This paper presents a wearable Internet of Things (IoT) sensor node aimed at monitoring harmful environmental conditions for safety applications via LoRa wireless technology. The proposed sensor node is low-power and supports multiple environmental sensors. A LoRa based gateway is used to connect sensors to the Internet. We mainly focus on monitoring carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ultraviolet, and some general environmental parameters. Poor environment quality could cause severe health problems to individuals. Therefore, surrounding environmental data is gathered by the wearable node in a real-time manner and then transmitted to a remote cloud server. The data can then be displayed to authorized users through a web-based application located in the cloud server and the device will give alert to the user via mobile application when an emergency condition occurs. The experimental results indicate that our safety monitoring network can work reliably with low power consumption.</p>},
